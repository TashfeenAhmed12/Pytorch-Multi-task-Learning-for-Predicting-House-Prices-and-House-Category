# Objective:
This project aims to construct a multi-task learning model capable of predicting both house prices and categorizing houses by their features using deep learning techniques. Utilizing the PyTorch Lightning framework, the model handles both regression and classification tasks within a unified architecture. By integrating advanced optimization tools like Optuna, the model dynamically fine-tunes hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance, offering valuable insights into the application of multi-task learning in real-world scenarios.
